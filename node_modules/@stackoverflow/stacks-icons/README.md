# Icons

![Icons](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/storage/user/84/files/417daa58-1b39-11e8-9c3c-f1108b31c896)

This repo provides authoring tools for Stack Overflowâ€™s shared icon library. Hereâ€™s our general workflow:

1. Open the [Sketch document](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Icons/blob/master/src/Icons.sketch) to modify an existing icon, or add a new one. Pay close attention to the name of the newly-added artboard. This will determine your SVGâ€™s filename.
2. Export each artboard to the `src/export` directory.
3. Open this repoâ€™s directory in Terminal, and type `grunt`. This will spit out optimized SVGs in the `build/lib` directory. Some manifest files are included in `build` as well.
4. Commit those optimized SVGs from `build/lib` to [Core/StackOverflow](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Core/StackOverflow) and [Design/Stacks](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks)

### Installing Grunt

In order to use this repo, you must first install [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, install [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) globally on your machine. Once both are installed, open this repoâ€™s directory in your Terminal. Once youâ€™re in this repoâ€™s folder, type `npm install`. This will download all the dependencies to a directory called `node_modules`. Now you can type `grunt` into the Terminal and itâ€™ll generate all the optimized SVGs and manifests in `build` that you exported to `src/export`. ðŸ˜Ž
