        <p class="d-m0 d-fs20 d-lh8">I have over 17 years of design experience, having spent the last 7 years as a Senior Product Designer at Dialpad and Stack Overflow before moving into my current role as a Product Design Manager.</p>
        <p class="d-mb0 d-fs20 d-lh8">I’m fascinated by distilling simple, intuitive solutions to complex user and business problems through thoughtful user experiences and beautiful interfaces. I also enjoy building design systems that solve these issues at scale. I’ve started and built two design systems: <a href="https://stackoverflow.design" class="d-link">Stacks</a> and <a href="https://dialpad.design" class="d-link">Dialtone</a>, both of which are still actively developed and utilized today.</p>
