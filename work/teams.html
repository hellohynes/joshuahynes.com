    <p class="jh-section--copy">The hardest problem at Stack Overflow isn’t creating the functionality to post questions or answers, notify users of these posts, calculate reputation, commenting, voting, or any of the other various tools that are used within a community (These are all core features to a Stack Overflow community.) The hardest problem is starting a community.</p>
    <p class="jh-section--copy">If you’ve ever tried to start a forum discussion, chat, or other type of online group, you’ve experienced the massive amount of effort needed to start that group. And once the community starts generating some momentum, your work doesn’t go away — it shifts toward increasing the community’s momentum. It’s difficult work, which is rarely recognized.</p>
    <p class="jh-section--copy">In fact, if you’re a part of a community like this — take a minute and tell the community owners how much you appreciate the effort they put into helping shepherd and guide that community.</p>

    <p class="jh-section--copy">One interesting feature about the Stack Exchange network is that anyone can suggest creating a new community. If there’s a knowledge area that interests you and potentially interests others, you can submit your idea on our “Area 51” website. This website walks you through a number of steps to help you go from a community idea to an actual Q&A community.</p>
    <p class="jh-section--copy">One criteria we’ve held for new communities is that they need to be of a certain size and show consistent growth for us to “graduate” that community as an official Stack Exchange network site. There have been hundreds of proposals submitted, and failure to reach the needed community size is consistently a top reason for a community’s inability to graduate.</p>

    <h3 class="jh-section--headline">Understanding the problem</h3>
    <p class="jh-section--copy">One of the largest, initial problems for Stack Overflow for Teams then was a three-fold problem:</p>
    <ol class="jh-section--copy">
        <li>Communities are hard to start.</li>
        <li>Smaller communities are even tougher to start and maintain.</li>
        <li>An inability to solve problems 1 and 2 will mean Stack Overflow for Teams doesn’t have a future.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="jh-section--copy">This is a big problem. It’s also a unique problem. How do we help anybody start their own private Q&A community and be successful at it?</p>

    <p class="jh-section--copy">Thankfully we had already been starting to think about this problem for our Stack Overflow Enterprise customers. Through this team’s work and other work the User Research team conducted, we started to learn a few key things:</p>
